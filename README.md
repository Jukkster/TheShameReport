# TheShameReport
First commit to the readme file on my GitHub. 

The Shame Report is an app to help you partner with a friend, family member or loved one for you both to track each others progress toward a fitness goal. Enter food, exercise and indulgences and the app will generate an email report to be sent to your Shame partner.
